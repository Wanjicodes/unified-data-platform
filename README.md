**A production-grade data engineering platform for hostile, fragmented, multi-source environments.**

Most data engineering projects start with clean data. This one does not.

This platform was designed around a real operational constraint I have worked with in practice: multiple enterprise clients, each with their own source systems, inconsistent field definitions, conflicting KPI logic and no shared data infrastructure all requiring trusted, decision-ready outputs simultaneously, across 12 markets.

It is not a tutorial or a demo. This is a reference architecture built from genuine experience structuring messy source data, standardising metric logic, and building systems that make analysis trusted, reusable and decision-ready.

## The problem this solves

Large organisations particularly in aviation, healthcare, fintech, among others often face the same data problems:

- **Fragmented source**: critical data is spread across disconnected systems with no canonical model
- **Inconsistent definitions**: teams and markets calculate the same metrics differently
- **Low trust in reporting**: stakeholders lose confidence when figures do not reconcile
- **Fragile pipelines**: manual fixes gradually become part of the operating process

This platform addresses these issues through a governed model, consistent metric definitions, automated reconciliation and more resilient pipelines.

Orchestration: Prefect flows wrap all layers with scheduling,
retry logic, and structured failure logging.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion | Python · `httpx` · `pandas` | Modular connector pattern — swap sources without touching pipeline logic |
| Validation | Custom data contracts · `great_expectations` | Contracts defined in YAML — validation is configuration, not code |
| Transform | `dbt` · DuckDB | Full staging → intermediate → mart lineage with documented metric definitions |
| Orchestration | `Prefect` | Parameterised flows, retry logic, structured failure logs |
| Serving | `FastAPI` | Data as a product — metrics and lineage exposed as versioned API endpoints |
| Observability | Custom monitors · structured logging | Pipeline health visible without external tooling dependencies |
| Testing | `pytest` · dbt tests | Contract tests, pipeline unit tests, and dbt schema tests in one run |

## Key design decisions

See [`/docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/) for full Architecture Decision Records.

**ADR-001**: Why data contracts are defined in YAML, not enforced in code  
**ADR-002**: Why DuckDB over PostgreSQL for local transform  
**ADR-003**: Why Prefect over Airflow for this architecture  
**ADR-004**: Why the metric store is separated from the reporting layer

cd unified-data-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run pipeline end to end (demo mode - aviation dataset)

# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Generate dbt docs
cd transform && dbt docs generate && dbt docs serve
```

## Demo dataset

The platform ships with a public aviation operations dataset (sourced from OpenFlights + BTS) as the default demo input. This illustrates the fragmentation problem concretely: two sources, different schemas, conflicting route identifiers, and inconsistent delay categorisation which is unified by the platform into a single trusted operational view.

**The aviation dataset is illustrative. The architecture cuts across:**
- Energy: multi-site consumption + pricing feeds with conflicting unit definitions
- Fintech: transaction systems with market-level rule variations
- Healthcare: patient data across clinic systems with no shared identifier

## Case studies

See [`/docs/case-studies/`](docs/case-studies/) for anonymised write-ups of real fragmented data environments this architecture pattern was built to solve.

## What this demonstrates

- **Data contracts as configuration** — validation rules defined in YAML, not buried in transformation code
- **Metric governance** — every KPI has an owner, a definition, and a test. No undocumented metrics.
- **Layer separation** — ingestion, validation, transform, and serving are independently deployable and testable
- **Production discipline** — structured failure logging, retry logic, lineage tracking, and schema versioning from day one
- **Data as a product** — outputs exposed as versioned API endpoints, not just files or tables

**Wanjiru Ndung'u** — Data Engineer

I build scalable data systems, metric layers and decision infrastructure for enterprise analytics and applied data science. My work sits at the intersection of data engineering, analytics engineering and business problem-solving — structuring messy source data, designing reliable transformation workflows, improving data quality, standardising metric logic, and building systems that make analysis more trusted, reusable and decision-ready.

Currently extending public proof in data engineering, analytics engineering, forecasting, experimentation and governance-minded data systems.
