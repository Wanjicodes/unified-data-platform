# unified-data-platform

**A production-grade data engineering platform for hostile, fragmented, multi-source environments.**

Most data engineering projects start with clean data. This one doesn't.

This platform was designed around a real operational constraint: multiple enterprise clients, each with their own source systems, inconsistent field definitions, conflicting KPI logic, and no shared data infrastructure — all requiring trusted, decision-ready outputs simultaneously.

It is not a tutorial. It is not a demo. It is a reference architecture for engineers who need to build reliable data systems where the data environment itself is the primary challenge.

## The problem this solves

Large organisations — in aviation, energy, fintech, and multi-market commercial operations — share a common data failure pattern:

- **Source fragmentation**: data lives in 4–10 disconnected systems with no canonical model
- **Definition conflicts**: the same metric means different things in different markets or teams
- **Trust collapse**: stakeholders stop trusting reports because numbers don't reconcile
- **Pipeline fragility**: manual fixes and workarounds become load-bearing infrastructure

This platform addresses all four at the architectural level — not as patches, but as first principles.

Orchestration: Prefect flows wrap all layers with scheduling,
retry logic, and structured failure logging.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion | Python · `httpx` · `pandas` | Modular connector pattern — swap sources without touching pipeline logic |
| Validation | Custom data contracts · `great_expectations` | Contracts defined in YAML — validation is configuration, not code |
| Transform | `dbt` · DuckDB | Full staging → intermediate → mart lineage with documented metric definitions |
| Orchestration | `Prefect` | Parameterised flows, retry logic, structured failure logs |
| Serving | `FastAPI` | Data as a product — metrics and lineage exposed as versioned API endpoints |
| Observability | Custom monitors · structured logging | Pipeline health visible without external tooling dependencies |
| Testing | `pytest` · dbt tests | Contract tests, pipeline unit tests, and dbt schema tests in one run |

## Key design decisions

See [`/docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/) for full Architecture Decision Records.

**ADR-001**: Why data contracts are defined in YAML, not enforced in code  
**ADR-002**: Why DuckDB over PostgreSQL for local transform  
**ADR-003**: Why Prefect over Airflow for this architecture  
**ADR-004**: Why the metric store is separated from the reporting layer

## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unified-data-platform
cd unified-data-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run pipeline end to end (demo mode — aviation dataset)
python orchestration/pipeline_dag.py --source aviation --mode demo

# Start the serving API
uvicorn serving.api:app --reload

# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Generate dbt docs
cd transform && dbt docs generate && dbt docs serve
```

## Demo dataset

The platform ships with a public aviation operations dataset (sourced from OpenFlights + BTS) as the default demo input. This illustrates the fragmentation problem concretely: two sources, different schemas, conflicting route identifiers, and inconsistent delay categorisation — unified by the platform into a single trusted operational view.

**The aviation dataset is illustrative. The architecture applies equally to:**
- Energy: multi-site consumption + pricing feeds with conflicting unit definitions
- Fintech: transaction systems with market-level rule variations
- Healthcare: patient data across clinic systems with no shared identifier

---

## Case studies

See [`/docs/case-studies/`](docs/case-studies/) for anonymised write-ups of real fragmented data environments this architecture pattern was built to solve.

## What this demonstrates

- **Data contracts as configuration** — validation rules defined in YAML, not buried in transformation code
- **Metric governance** — every KPI has an owner, a definition, and a test. No undocumented metrics.
- **Layer separation** — ingestion, validation, transform, and serving are independently deployable and testable
- **Production discipline** — structured failure logging, retry logic, lineage tracking, and schema versioning from day one
- **Data as a product** — outputs exposed as versioned API endpoints, not just files or tables
